### Official Versions
[Actual Repo](https://github.com/A-Proof/ModernOS-Cortex/releases)
* ModernOS Everest (Public Early Access Release, v1.0.0) - ModernOS Everest is right now still being worked on, but it is **80%** done. The disk image provided on December 4th of 2025 was a mere preview.
* ModernOS Everest (Stable release, v1.05) - Awaits formal release. **According to the release schedule, Mid December 2025**... We'll see.

  ### Kernel Versions && Architectures
 * ForgeC - Private Legacy ModernOS versions such as v0.0.1-core and v0.1.0-legacy. **ForgeC is a Assembly Rust based kernel** that uses advanced tech to display simple VGA graphics in (320x200x56).
 * AnchorC - Public Beta ModernOS versions ranging from v0.2.0 (public), v0.3.0 (public), v0.4.0 (public), v0.5.0 (private), v0.60-install (private), and v0.99-beta-C (private). AnchorC is the general public kernel using stdint.h, stdbool.h and stdlib.h. It works using C and minimal Rust.
 * Q0J - Q0 was the Java-based kernel used in Java experiments for the OS. Java does not work sadly and we had to rethink what to do with the OS.
 * Q1 - Q1 is the current kernel iteration from QWERTY Kernel Interface System, v1.0.0. In there we use Q1 but plan on adding Q1-Lite instead of Q1 to ModernOS Everest. Everest is the first **stable** release. It uses C and Flutter. Some headers include: sync.h, math.h, eq.h and UEFI.h.
 * Q1-Skyhigh - Skyhigh is our open-sourced iteration of the Qwerty kernel releasing in Late December. It includes many features we aren't exposing. Built in C.
  


## Features
ModernOS Everest will include many features for everyday use, including a browser, glassy and recognizable elements and more! There will only be Everest Free for now, but paid versions with advanced capabilities will be built later. Most likely in the 1.1 Update.
Everest also has a **special** technology called the *Q* kernel. It **will be open sourced soon, but for now, it's not.**
 The first release which will be here, also known as **v1.0-cyber** will not be extremely stable for we are still developing the first generation of **QWERTY Kernels**.
